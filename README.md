## Big Sur 
For the fisrt install. Boot with EFI_big_sir_boot first. It will take a long time to install Big Sur. So, please be patient. After boot into the system, then replace EFI_big_sir_boot with EFI. Finally, make sure to change [Airportitlwm](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/releases) to big sur version.

DO NOT RESTART thinking you're stuck, this will take quite some time(16mins) to complete, otherwise you'll break your installation.

Thanks to 宪武. He has done a lot of works on 4k display. But still, there are some problems need to be fixed.

You'll need to change your device proverties in config.
